# Challenge 22: Home Sales Data Analysis with SparkSQL

## Overview

In this challenge, we will leverage SparkSQL to analyze home sales data by computing key metrics. We will also work with Spark's features to create temporary views, partition data, cache and uncache tables, and verify the uncaching process.

## Objectives

Use SparkSQL to analyze home sales data.

Create temporary views in Spark.

Partition data to optimize query performance.

Cache and uncache a temporary table.

Verify that the table has been uncached.

## Requirements

Apache Spark

PySpark or Spark with Scala

Jupyter Notebook or a Spark-enabled environment

Home sales dataset (provided or sourced)

## Instructions

Load the Data: Import the home sales dataset into Spark.

Explore the Data: Use SparkSQL to compute key metrics such as average sale price, total sales per region, and time trends.

Create Temporary Views: Store intermediate results using Spark temporary views.

Partition the Data: Organize the data for efficient querying and analysis.

Cache a Table: Store a frequently accessed table in memory.

Uncache the Table: Remove the table from memory and verify that it has been uncached.

## Expected Output

Summary statistics for home sales data.

Performance improvements using partitions and caching.

Confirmation of uncached tables.
